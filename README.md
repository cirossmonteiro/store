# My personal website

I decided to host all my files from my website here just in case the VPS hired fails to ensure the codes.

I intend to exhibit my learning in web development. It means all you see in this repository was made completely by me.

You may find some picure files (nothing a minor shouldn't see in the internet) that really appears in my site.

The address is 140.82.27.108, in case you're curious to see what it's like.

I may share some articles too, in order to show I can talk about other stuff.
